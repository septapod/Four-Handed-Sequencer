Hello! Thank you for downloading the Wearable Synesthetic Pokey Slappy Makey Four-Handed Sequencer. 

==TO USE==

1. Open "Handsy Tunsey.maxpat"

2. Select a key (for example: C, C#, D, etc)

3. Turn on the sequencer.

4. Play! 

==TRY THIS==

You have four tracks to play with, each track will add a new layer of music to your song. Try changing tracks and adding layers.

Use the keys to move up and down an octave. You'll hear the octave level you're at with each change.

"Freestyle mode" allows you to play over your created song without adding to the sequence.

==VIDEO==

Synesthesia is a condition in which one sense (for example, hearing) is simultaneously perceived as if by one or more additional senses such as sight(1). 

Turn on the video for a synesthetic experience. Each of your notes will change your video a different color. Each video square repents a different track.

Use "Full Screen" mode if you have your computer attached to a second display or projector to show your synthetic video to the whole room while you're still able to access the control interface.


==CONTROLS==

This application is designed to operate with a pair of hand-crafted gloves attached to a MaKey MaKey (http://www.makeymakey.com). Lucky for you, it also works with your keyboard too.
